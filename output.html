<p>Global heating has <a href='http://e360.yale.edu/feature/a_world_centered_on_sea_ice_is_changing_swiftly_at_the_poles/2420/'>caused big</a> ecological changes at the poles.</p>
<p>In the Antarctic, water-filled salps grow instead of krill,
resulting in little food that penguins and seals can eat.</p>
<p>In the Arctic, the time of phytoplankton blooms has shifted almost two
months earlier, so whales and birds arrive too late and find little to
eat.</p>
<p>It will only get worse.</p>
