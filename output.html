<p>Rather than slinking off to die separately, they should unite and fight.  The worst that will happen is that they die as heroes &mdash; and they might discourage further land grabbing, or even win.</p>

<p>I didn't give any credence to these accusations until I read that the ICC did.  They are very clearly the sort of thing that is used to manipulate public opinion.  So my views about Libya were never based on them.</p>

<p>This is partly due to the high level of unemployment, partly due to decades of campaigns to weaken unions, and partly due to globalization which was engineered through antidemocratic international institutions such as the WTO.</p>

<p>In the Antarctic, water-filled salps grow instead of krill, resulting in little food that penguins and seals can eat.</p>
<p>In the Arctic, the time of phytoplankton blooms has shifted almost two months earlier, so whales and birds arrive too late and find little to eat.</p>
