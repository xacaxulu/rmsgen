Many US companies check the credit ratings of potential employees; the
result is that anyone who becomes unemployed and falls behind on bills
does not get hired again.

http://www.miller-mccune.com/business-economics/credit-report-dogging-job-seekers-31834/

While this is a crowning unfairness, fixing this would at best mean
that some people rotate more often in and out of unemployment.  The US must
do more to help the long-term unemployed and underemployed.

Tennessee has imposed stiff censorship on the Internet, by banning the
posting of images that are likely to "cause emotional distress" to
someone.

http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/tenn-law-bans-posting-images-that-cause-emotional-distress.ars

Will antiabortionists be prosecuted for posting images of fetuses?
(They certainly should know that these images can cause emotional
distress.)  Probably not &mdash; because the ban will be selectively
enforced by right-wing Christians.

[For Facebook section too]

Facebook has turned on automatic face recognition on photos.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/08/facebook-privacy-facial-recognition

Facebook says that it only suggests identifications for faces in photos
for people who are the user's friends.  However, it might run the algorithm
over every photo posted and not publicly announce the results.

I ask people not to post photos of me on Facebook.

Many UK schools make students use fingerprint recognition to get lunch.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/09/schools-surveillance-spying-on-pupils

And there is a plan to give teachers the power to search students'
computers at will, and delete files from them at will.
